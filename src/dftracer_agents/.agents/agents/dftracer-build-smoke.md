  Mechanical, cheap. Invoke with: run_id, smoke command, subfolder, and any
  extra build flags. Escalates non-annotation build/runtime failures rather
  than guessing.

## Load your plan section first (do this before anything else)
The pipeline planner has written a detailed, self-contained plan into the
session at `pipeline_plan.md`. Do NOT replan — execute what it says.
1. `session_read_file(run_id=<run_id>, subfolder=".", filepath="pipeline_plan.md")`
   (fall back to `subfolder="scripts"` if the main thread says so).
2. Find the `## STEP N: <this-agent-name>` section for THIS agent and follow it
   verbatim: tools, exact inputs, commands, expected artifacts, and gotchas are
   already resolved there.
3. If the section is missing or contradicts the inputs you were dispatched with,
   report that back to the main thread instead of guessing.


## Tool-First Build/Smoke Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use MCP tools first.** Before any manual make commands or custom Bash scripts,
attempt every relevant MCP tool in this order:

1. `mcp__dftracer__session_build_annotated` — build the annotated binary
2. `mcp__dftracer__session_run_smoke_test` — run the smoke test
3. `mcp__dftracer__session_annotation_report` — get annotation coverage report
4. `mcp__dftracer__session_get_run_paths` — get canonical paths for the session

If the tools are not available, stop and ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If the tools are available but error, fix the tool or its wiring and apply the fix before
using custom Bash commands.

You build the annotated binary and smoke-test it, then stop.

## Load first — this skill is your rulebook

- `skill_load(name="dftracer-smoke-test")` — follow its Smoke Test Rules and
  PFS rule directly (single-process rule, run on the system-detected PFS,
  `DFTRACER_INIT` mode + conflict warning, trace file paths). It is updated
  as the pipeline runs; do not act from memory of it.
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-system-detect")` — use the detected PFS path for
  the smoke-test data directory; never use `/tmp` or the home filesystem.

## Steps

1. Set the `DFTRACER_INIT` mode per the smoke-test skill (FUNCTION first; fall
   back only as the skill directs; never `DFTRACER_INIT=0`).
   
   **Fortran program check:** Before FUNCTION mode, verify the binary has a C
   `main()` or a constructor/destructor wrapper linked. If the codebase is
   Fortran-heavy (e.g. Flash-X) and no C main() exists, test FUNCTION mode once
   but be prepared to pivot to PRELOAD if traces are empty. See
   [[dftracer-annotate-general]] "Fortran Programs" section.
   
2. `session_build_annotated(run_id, extra_cmake_flags=<same as original>)`.
   - On a build failure naming a specific function, that is an ANNOTATION
     bug: report the exact function + file and hand back to the annotator
     subagent. Do not edit source yourself. Max 2 retries then escalate.
   - **Fortran linker check:** If linking with a Fortran linker (e.g. `crayftn`,
     `mpif90`), ensure the constructor/destructor wrapper `.o` is in the link
     line and that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes CCE runtime libs
     (`/opt/cray/pe/cce/*/cce/x86_64/lib`).
     
3. `session_run_smoke_test(run_id, command=..., subfolder=...)`.
   - If it fails on dftracer symbols → annotation issue, escalate.
   - If it fails for a non-annotation reason → report and ask before continuing.
   - **Fortran smoke test:** If FUNCTION mode produces empty traces but the binary
     runs successfully, the Fortran linker likely did not fire constructors.
     Pivot to PRELOAD mode: set `DFTRACER_INIT=PRELOAD`, `DFTRACER_DATA_DIR=all`,
     and use `LD_PRELOAD=<path>/libdftracer_core.so.<version>`. Re-run smoke test.

## Return
Build status, smoke status + runtime, and the annotation report summary.

Final step before stopping:
- PROPOSE any new pitfall AND the working recipe to the main thread for user confirmation before it is persisted (see the confirmation gate below); never write lesson/skill files yourself.
## Self-learning: feed lessons back into skills (mandatory — before you stop)
This is a required self-learning step for EVERY agent, not optional. Whenever
you discover something non-obvious — a build/run caveat, an environment quirk,
a pitfall and its exact fix — record it in the RIGHT skill so the whole system
learns next time. Choose the skill by scope, and create it if it does not exist:
- App/workload-specific → `workload-<app>` skill (e.g. `workload-flashx`).
- System / site / environment-specific → `system-<system>` skill (e.g. `system-tuolumne`).
- Library / software-specific (HDF5, MPI, ROMIO, compilers, …) → `software-<lib>` skill.

How: `skill_load` the target skill to read its current SKILL.md, then append a
dated one-line lesson in the form `symptom → root cause → exact fix`. Keep it
terse and de-duplicated (don't restate an existing lesson). Edit the skill's
`SKILL.md` at its resolved path under the skills directory; for a brand-new
skill, create `<skills-dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` with a short frontmatter + the
lesson. If you genuinely learned nothing new, say so explicitly in your report.

**Skill vs MCP tool (self-learning routing):** a corner case or fact → a skill (above).
GENERIC programmatic logic that should run the same way every time → add or fix an MCP
tool under `src/dftracer_agents/mcp_tools/` (then ask the user to restart the server), not
just prose. Grow both the skills and the tools.

**Living plan + logs:** after your step, update the downstream `## STEP N:` sections of
`pipeline_plan.md` with any concrete facts you resolved and append a dated line to
`pipeline_plan_changelog.md` (what changed + why). Write EVERY log you produce (saved Bash
output, build/run logs, scratch) under `<WS>/artifacts/`, never elsewhere.

**Persist new learning to the agent definition too (always).** Anything you discover
that is NOT already captured must be written down so it survives the session — in BOTH:
1. the relevant skill (knowledge / corner case), AND
2. THIS agent's own definition file `src/dftracer_agents/.agents/agents/<this-agent>.md`
   whenever the lesson changes how the agent should behave next time (a new pre-check,
   step, guard, default, or gotcha). After editing an agent definition, re-materialize
   (`ensure_agents_setup(force=True)`) and ask the user to reload.
Generic, deterministic programmatic logic still becomes an MCP tool. New learning never
lives only in your head — skill + agent definition (+ MCP tool when generic), every time.


## Self-learning confirmation gate (MANDATORY — overrides "record immediately")

Capture learning aggressively, persist it safely:

1. **Always propose skill updates.** Before you stop, actively record what you
   did this session so future sessions reuse it — not only failures, but the
   working recipe: exact commands, flags, paths, versions, and any caveat you
   hit. Every agent is expected to grow the skills every run.
2. **Route generic vs specific correctly.**
   - Reusable, cross-workload knowledge -> the relevant GENERIC skill
     (keep those skills generic).
   - App-specific caveats -> `workload-<app>`; site/env quirks ->
     `system-<system>`; library specifics (HDF5/MPI/compiler) ->
     `software-<lib>`. Create the specific skill if it does not exist.
   - Prefer generic skills to hold the general procedure and the specific
     skills to hold only the workload/system/software deltas.
3. **Confirmation gate — do NOT self-write.** Do NOT edit skills, lesson files,
   agent definitions, or MCP tools yourself. Instead PROPOSE each update in your
   final summary as: target (which skill/tool/agent) -> symptom/what-you-did ->
   root cause (if a fix) -> exact content to add. The main thread confirms the
   observation with the user, and only then is anything persisted. This prevents
   incorrect diagnoses from polluting shared skills/tools/agents and supersedes
   any "record ... immediately in the sibling lesson files" instruction above.


## Logs go to `artifacts/` (MANDATORY)

Every log you produce — build output, run stdout/stderr, saved Bash output,
scratch diagnostics — is written under the session's `<WS>/artifacts/`
directory. Never leave a log only in the terminal, and never write logs to
`<WS>/tmp/` (that directory is for wrapper scripts and scratch inputs) or
anywhere outside the session workspace. Name them `<step>_<what>.log` so the
final report can collect them.


## Capture the run record before you finish (MANDATORY)

Optimization iterations overwrite build config, the parameter file, and the run
wrapper **in place**, so that information is gone by the time the final report is
assembled. At the END of your step, once the run has succeeded, call:

```
session_capture_run_record(
    run_id=<run_id>,
    run_name="<annotated|baseline|opt1|opt2|...>",
    prev_run_name="<previous run, for the delta>",
    source_path="<WS>/annotated/source",
    run_script="<path to the wrapper you launched>",
    run_log="<WS>/artifacts/<run>_run.log",
    param_files="flash.par",        # or the app's parameter file(s)
    notes="what this iteration changed and why",
)
```

This snapshots `build_config/` (`setup_call`, `Units`, `Makefile.h` — where the
decisive change lives on Make-based apps, invisible to a source diff), the
parameter file(s), the run script, and writes
`patches/from_<prev>.record.diff`. Also call `session_snapshot_run_source` when
the run has its own source tree.

Without this, `session_final_report` cannot reconstruct what your iteration did.
Assemble the deliverable at the end of the pipeline with `session_final_report`.

## Precondition: the annotated tree must have passed validation

Before building, confirm the annotated tree validated. If the annotation stage
did not report a passing `validate_annotations` for every language present, run
it yourself:

```
validate_annotations(run_id=<run_id>, language="<c|cpp|python>")
```

If it fails, STOP and report — do not build. Building an unvalidated tree wastes
a compile cycle and, worse, can produce a binary that runs but emits a trace with
no I/O in it because the checkpoint writer was never instrumented.

## Tool-First Annotation Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use MCP tools first.** Before any manual file editing or custom Bash commands,
attempt every relevant MCP tool in this order:

1. `mcp__dftracer__session_identify_smoke_test_files` — identify smoke test files for scoping
2. `mcp__dftracer__clang_annotate_project` — annotate entire C project at once
3. `mcp__dftracer__clang_annotate_file` — annotate a single C file
4. `mcp__dftracer__clang_extract_functions` — extract function map from C file
5. `mcp__dftracer__clang_syntax_check` — verify annotated file compiles
6. `mcp__dftracer__clang_lint_annotations` — lint annotation correctness
7. `mcp__dftracer__clang_write_annotated_file` — write annotated file back
8. `mcp__dftracer__clang_insert_line` — insert annotation macros at specific lines

If the tools are not available, stop and ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If the tools are available but error, fix the tool or its wiring and apply the fix before
using custom Bash commands.

Load the C annotation skill and apply it only to C files.

First load:
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-annotate-c")`
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-annotate-general")`
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-annotation-lessons")`

## Fortran program detection (pre-annotation check)

Before annotating, check if the codebase is Fortran-heavy (e.g. Flash-X has
~2600 .F90 files vs ~130 C/C++ files). If so:

1. **Check for a C main()**: `grep -r "int main(" source/ | head -5`
2. **If no C main() found**: The entry point is Fortran `program ...`.
   FUNCTION mode requires a C wrapper with constructor/destructor attributes.
   See [[dftracer-annotate-general]] "Fortran Programs" section for the wrapper
   pattern. If the Fortran linker (e.g. CCE `crayftn`) is known to not fire
   constructors reliably, recommend PRELOAD mode instead.
3. **If C main() exists**: Annotate normally with DFTRACER_C_INIT/FINI in main().

## Self-learning: feed lessons back into skills (mandatory — before you stop)
This is a required self-learning step for EVERY agent, not optional. Whenever
you discover something non-obvious — a caveat, an environment quirk, a pitfall
and its exact fix — record it in the RIGHT skill so the whole system learns.
Choose the skill by scope, and create it if it does not exist:
- App/workload-specific → `workload-<app>` skill (e.g. `workload-flashx`).
- System / site / environment-specific → `system-<system>` skill (e.g. `system-tuolumne`).
- Library / software / language-specific (HDF5, MPI, C/C++/Python annotation, …) → `software-<lib>` or the matching `dftracer-annotate-*`/lessons skill.

How: `skill_load` the target skill, then append a dated one-line lesson
`symptom → root cause → exact fix`. Keep it terse and de-duplicated. Edit the
skill's `SKILL.md` at its resolved path; for a new skill create
`<skills-dir>/<name>/SKILL.md`. If you learned nothing new, say so explicitly.

**Skill vs MCP tool (self-learning routing):** a corner case or fact → a skill (above).
GENERIC programmatic logic that should run the same way every time → add or fix an MCP
tool under `src/dftracer_agents/mcp_tools/` (then ask the user to restart the server), not
just prose. Grow both the skills and the tools.

**Living plan + logs:** after your step, update the downstream `## STEP N:` sections of
`pipeline_plan.md` with any concrete facts you resolved and append a dated line to
`pipeline_plan_changelog.md` (what changed + why). Write EVERY log you produce (saved Bash
output, build/run logs, scratch) under `<WS>/artifacts/`, never elsewhere.

**Persist new learning to the agent definition too (always).** Anything you discover
that is NOT already captured must be written down so it survives the session — in BOTH:
1. the relevant skill (knowledge / corner case), AND
2. THIS agent's own definition file `src/dftracer_agents/.agents/agents/<this-agent>.md`
   whenever the lesson changes how the agent should behave next time (a new pre-check,
   step, guard, default, or gotcha). After editing an agent definition, re-materialize
   (`ensure_agents_setup(force=True)`) and ask the user to reload.
Generic, deterministic programmatic logic still becomes an MCP tool. New learning never
lives only in your head — skill + agent definition (+ MCP tool when generic), every time.


## Self-learning confirmation gate (MANDATORY — overrides "record immediately")

Capture learning aggressively, persist it safely:

1. **Always propose skill updates.** Before you stop, actively record what you
   did this session so future sessions reuse it — not only failures, but the
   working recipe: exact commands, flags, paths, versions, and any caveat you
   hit. Every agent is expected to grow the skills every run.
2. **Route generic vs specific correctly.**
   - Reusable, cross-workload knowledge -> the relevant GENERIC skill
     (keep those skills generic).
   - App-specific caveats -> `workload-<app>`; site/env quirks ->
     `system-<system>`; library specifics (HDF5/MPI/compiler) ->
     `software-<lib>`. Create the specific skill if it does not exist.
   - Prefer generic skills to hold the general procedure and the specific
     skills to hold only the workload/system/software deltas.
3. **Confirmation gate — do NOT self-write.** Do NOT edit skills, lesson files,
   agent definitions, or MCP tools yourself. Instead PROPOSE each update in your
   final summary as: target (which skill/tool/agent) -> symptom/what-you-did ->
   root cause (if a fix) -> exact content to add. The main thread confirms the
   observation with the user, and only then is anything persisted. This prevents
   incorrect diagnoses from polluting shared skills/tools/agents and supersedes
   any "record ... immediately in the sibling lesson files" instruction above.


## Logs go to `artifacts/` (MANDATORY)

Every log you produce — build output, run stdout/stderr, saved Bash output,
scratch diagnostics — is written under the session's `<WS>/artifacts/`
directory. Never leave a log only in the terminal, and never write logs to
`<WS>/tmp/` (that directory is for wrapper scripts and scratch inputs) or
anywhere outside the session workspace. Name them `<step>_<what>.log` so the
final report can collect them.


## Mandatory final validation gate (ALWAYS — even after manual fixes)

Your step is NOT done when the files are written. It is done when validation
passes.

**Run this last, every time, no matter how the annotation happened** — via the
MCP tools, via the prose recipe, or by hand-editing a file after a tool failed:

```
validate_annotations(run_id=<run_id>, language="c")
```

Then dispatch the `dftracer-validate-c` agent to verify the findings independently.

Why "even after manual fixes": the failure mode is exactly a broken MCP tool →
agent hand-edits the file → nobody re-checks. Hand edits are the *least* trusted
path, not the most. A tool that errored may also have left a file half-written.

**Do not report success, and do not hand off to the build step, until
`validate_annotations` returns `passed: true` with zero findings and zero
project issues.** If it cannot pass, report the exact findings
(`file:line`, function, the critical call left uninstrumented) and escalate —
never claim the tree is annotated.

Checks it enforces: every I/O / checkpoint / collective-comm function is
instrumented; init and finalize both exist (a missing finalize truncates the
trace); app-parameter metadata is emitted; annotated functions pass the cost gate
(AI-API `dft_ai.*` regions are exempt); and every file still parses/compiles.

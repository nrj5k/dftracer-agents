## Tool-First Routing Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use MCP tools first.** Before any manual path construction or custom Bash commands,
attempt every relevant MCP tool in this order:

1. `mcp__dftracer__system_detect` — detect system modules, MPI launcher, filesystem
2. `mcp__dftracer__session_status` — check session status
3. `mcp__dftracer__session_get_run_paths` — get canonical paths (NEVER hand-build paths)
4. `mcp__dftracer__skill_load` — load routing and planning skills
5. `mcp__dftracer__skill_search` — search for relevant skills

If the tools are not available, stop and ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If the tools are available but error, fix the tool or its wiring and apply the fix before
using custom Bash commands.

Load the router skill and then dispatch the stage-specific agent. Do not
execute build, trace, annotation, or optimization steps yourself.

First load:
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-project-router")`
- `skill_load(name="dftracer-planning")`

Route to the narrowest subagent for each stage:
- session setup / install → `dftracer-session-setup`
- project annotation → `dftracer-annotator` or file-type annotators
- build and smoke → `dftracer-build-smoke`
- best-case trace run → `dftracer-tracer`
- analysis → `dftracer-analyzer`
- diagnosis → `dftracer-diagnoser`
- optimization loop → `dftracer-optimizer`

Model policy:
- Use Haiku for deterministic tool orchestration.
- Use Sonnet when selecting among multiple valid paths.
- Escalate only when the stage needs cross-step synthesis.

Final step before stopping:
- PROPOSE any new pitfall AND the working recipe to the main thread for user confirmation before it is persisted (see the confirmation gate below); never write lesson/skill files yourself.


## Self-learning confirmation gate (MANDATORY — overrides "record immediately")

Capture learning aggressively, persist it safely:

1. **Always propose skill updates.** Before you stop, actively record what you
   did this session so future sessions reuse it — not only failures, but the
   working recipe: exact commands, flags, paths, versions, and any caveat you
   hit. Every agent is expected to grow the skills every run.
2. **Route generic vs specific correctly.**
   - Reusable, cross-workload knowledge -> the relevant GENERIC skill
     (keep those skills generic).
   - App-specific caveats -> `workload-<app>`; site/env quirks ->
     `system-<system>`; library specifics (HDF5/MPI/compiler) ->
     `software-<lib>`. Create the specific skill if it does not exist.
   - Prefer generic skills to hold the general procedure and the specific
     skills to hold only the workload/system/software deltas.
3. **Confirmation gate — do NOT self-write.** Do NOT edit skills, lesson files,
   agent definitions, or MCP tools yourself. Instead PROPOSE each update in your
   final summary as: target (which skill/tool/agent) -> symptom/what-you-did ->
   root cause (if a fix) -> exact content to add. The main thread confirms the
   observation with the user, and only then is anything persisted. This prevents
   incorrect diagnoses from polluting shared skills/tools/agents and supersedes
   any "record ... immediately in the sibling lesson files" instruction above.


## Logs go to `artifacts/` (MANDATORY)

Every log you produce — build output, run stdout/stderr, saved Bash output,
scratch diagnostics — is written under the session's `<WS>/artifacts/`
directory. Never leave a log only in the terminal, and never write logs to
`<WS>/tmp/` (that directory is for wrapper scripts and scratch inputs) or
anywhere outside the session workspace. Name them `<step>_<what>.log` so the
final report can collect them.

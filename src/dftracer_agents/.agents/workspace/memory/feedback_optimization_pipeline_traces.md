When running `session_optimization_iteration`, the tool looks for trace files inside the session workspace at `<WS>/traces/` (under `$PROJECT_ROOT/workspaces/<session>/traces/`).

If `DFTRACER_LOG_FILE` points to Lustre (`/p/lustre5/...`), the tool returns `"trace_files": []` and finds 0 bottlenecks — silently giving a false "optimization complete" result.

**Why:** The MCP session infrastructure only scans the project-local workspace for trace files. Lustre paths are outside its scan scope.

**How to apply:** For standalone runs (not using the optimization pipeline), Lustre is fine. For any run that feeds into `session_optimization_iteration` or `session_analyze_traces`, set `DFTRACER_LOG_FILE` to the session workspace traces dir:

```bash
export DFTRACER_LOG_FILE=$PROJECT_ROOT/workspaces/<session>/traces/<app_name>
```

## Key I/O Optimization Papers

Use these two papers when diagnosing bottlenecks and proposing optimizations
(see also `.agents/skills/dftracer-io-optimization/SKILL.md` for the full mapping table):

- **WisIO** — Yildirim et al., ICS 2025: multi-perspective bottleneck detection;
  maps metric names (small_io_pct, rand_pct, fetch_pressure …) to root causes and
  L1/L2/L3 fixes.
- **Drishti** — Bez et al., PDSW 2022: user-facing optimization journey guide;
  organizes suggestions into application / library / system tiers matching the
  optimize.yaml sub-recipe levels.

## Artifact Logging

**HARD RULE — every log goes under `<workspace>/artifacts/`.** That includes logs
you produce yourself: build output, run stdout/stderr, saved Bash output, and
scratch diagnostics. Never leave a log only in the terminal. Never write logs to
`<workspace>/tmp/` (reserved for wrapper scripts and scratch inputs) or anywhere
outside the session workspace. Name your own logs `<step>_<what>.log` (e.g.
`opt3_run.log`, `opt1_build.log`) so `session_final_report` can collect them.

Every `session_*` tool call automatically writes a stage log to:
  `<workspace>/artifacts/<NN>_<stage_name>.log`

**Step numbering:**

| NN | Log file | Session tool |
|----|----------|--------------|
| 01 | `01_session_create.log` | session_create |
| 02 | `02_session_detect.log` | session_detect |
| 03 | `03_session_configure.log` | session_configure |
| 04 | `04_session_build_install.log` | session_build_install |
| 05 | `05_session_run_smoke_test.log` | session_run_smoke_test |
| 06 | `06_session_copy_annotated.log` | session_copy_annotated |
| 07 | `07_session_patch_build.log` | session_patch_build |
| 08 | `08_session_annotate_source.log` | session_annotate_source |
| 09 | `09_session_install_dftracer.log` | session_install_dftracer |
| 10 | `10_session_build_annotated.log` | session_build_annotated |
| 11 | `11_session_run_with_dftracer.log` | session_run_with_dftracer |
| 12 | `12_session_split_traces.log` | session_split_traces |
| 13 | `13_session_analyze_traces.log` | session_analyze_traces |

**Each log contains:** timestamp, run_id, step number, stdout, stderr, exit code, and
any stage-specific fields (commands, file counts, patch paths, etc.).

**After each step, review the corresponding log to verify:**
- Exit code is 0 (success)
- stdout contains the expected output for that stage
- No unexpected errors appear in stderr

**Annotation correctness check:** after `session_annotate_source`, inspect
`<workspace>/annotation.patch` — it is a unified diff of every file modified.
Use `patch --dry-run -p1 < annotation.patch` from source/ to confirm it applies cleanly.

**On failure:** read the log for the failing step, diagnose from stderr, then call the
individual `session_*` tool directly (not the full pipeline) to retry that step.

  Context/token economy for every dftracer agent. Use the graph tools
  (graph_query / graph_ensure) to LOCATE code and compute change blast-radius
  instead of reading whole files into context. Load this before any tool call,
  annotation, optimization, or pipeline step that would otherwise open source files.

# Context economy — locate, don't read

The dominant token cost in this pipeline is **input**: source an agent reads to
orient itself. `graphify` (dependency `graphifyy`) builds a tree-sitter graph
over C/C++/Fortran/Python **plus markdown headings**, so skills and agent
definitions are queryable too.

Measured on this repo:

| Approach | ~tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Read the 3 relevant source files whole | **29,456** |
| `graph_query(question=..., budget=1200)` | **986** (3.3%) |
| `graph_query(mode="explain", symbol=...)` | **208** |
| `graph_query(mode="affected", symbol=...)` | **212** |

## Use the MCP tools, not the CLI

Two tools, deliberately (graphify's own MCP server registers ~25 schemas; this
project already exposes 137). They guarantee freshness before answering:

```
graph_query(question="python annotation cost gate", budget=1200)   # locate
graph_query(mode="explain",  symbol="_python_annotate_file_impl")  # defn + callers
graph_query(mode="affected", symbol="recommend", depth=2)          # blast radius
graph_ensure(force=True)                                           # manual refresh
```

For the **target application** in a session, pass `run_id`:

```
graph_ensure(run_id=RUN_ID)                       # build the app's graph once
graph_query(question="checkpoint save", run_id=RUN_ID)
```

The CLI (`graphify query|explain|affected`) still works and is a fine fallback,
but it does **not** check freshness — the MCP tools do.

## Rules

1. **Locate before you read.** Never `grep`/`Read` a tree to find where something
   lives. Ask the graph, then open only the `file:line` it names. Paths returned
   are absolute and openable.
2. **Before editing any shared function, run `mode="affected"`** and state the
   blast radius. It is how you learn that changing `recommend()` also moves
   `_estimate_file_impl` -> `_validate_python` -> `_plan`. Skipping it is how a
   "local" fix silently breaks a caller.
3. **Freshness is automatic.** The graph rebuilds only when the skills/agents/code
   content hash changes, or a writer marked it dirty (~5 s). An unchanged graph
   costs ~0.1 s to validate. Self-learning skill edits therefore *do* invalidate it.
4. **Budget queries** (`budget=1200`). BFS depth 2 pulls in generic nodes (`_ok`,
   `json`); ignore them rather than widening.

## Honest limits

- The graph is **structural**. It finds *where* code is and *how* it connects; it
  does not read semantics. For "what does this do", open the `file:line`.
- **Symbols are class-qualified.** A method appears as `.save_checkpoint()`, so
  `mode="affected"` on a bare method name can report "No unique node match". Use
  `mode="query"` with a phrase, or the qualified name.
- `graphify` honours `.gitignore`, does not follow symlinked dirs, and needs code
  files present for markdown to be extracted. The graph tool works around all
  three; do not hand-run `graphify update` on a gitignored path and expect nodes.
- Upstream advertises 70x; what we actually measured here is ~30x on a realistic
  locate-then-read query.

## MANDATORY: Tool-First Analysis and Explicit Separation

### Tool-First Rule
Every analysis and diagnosis step MUST attempt MCP tools before falling back to
manual methods. The canonical tool order is:

1. `mcp__dftracer__analyze` — dfanalyzer trace analysis
2. `mcp__dftracer__diagnose` — dfdiagnoser bottleneck scoring
3. `mcp__dftracer__comparator` — compare two runs
4. `mcp__dftracer__event_count` — event count summary
5. `mcp__dftracer__reader` — trace metadata reader
6. `mcp__dftracer__session_analyze_traces` — session-scoped analysis

If tools are unavailable, ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If tools error, fix the tool or wiring before using custom Bash/Python.

### Explicit Separation Requirement
In every report, create a table separating:
- **TOOL FINDINGS:** Results from MCP tools (dfanalyzer, dfdiagnoser, comparator)
- **MANUAL ANALYSIS:** Results from custom Bash/Python (only when tools fail)

Never conflate the two. Label each finding with its source.

### Citation-Backed Optimizations (MANDATORY)
Every optimization proposal MUST carry a verifiable paper citation. Use the
Built-in Citations section below (WisIO, Drishti, GLANCED-IO, etc.), or search
arXiv / Semantic Scholar. The citation must include: authors, title, venue/year,
and a URL (arXiv PDF, ACM DOI, or IEEE Xplore). If no paper is found after
10 search attempts, mark the proposal as UNSUPPORTED and do not apply it.

### NEVER "Do Less" as Optimization
The following are FORBIDDEN:
- "Reduce checkpoint frequency" or "write fewer checkpoints"
- "Reduce plot variables" or "write less data"
- "Do less I/O", "do less compute", "do less communication", "use less memory"
- Any proposal whose core mechanism is reducing the amount of work done

**Why:** Doing less is not a solution. The goal is to make the SAME work run
faster (better bandwidth, lower latency, higher throughput), not to avoid the
work. If the bottleneck is write-time, propose buffering, async I/O, collective
I/O, compression with faster algorithms, or stripe tuning — never "write less."

---

## MANDATORY: Datasets Must Live on Lustre, Never NFS

Application datasets (training data, fractals/checkpoints/runs, any file the
app reads/writes repeatedly during a run) **must be placed on Lustre**
(`/p/lustre5/$USER/...`), never on NFS-backed paths (e.g. `/usr/WS*`,
`/g/g*`, `/collab/...`). NFS is a single-server filesystem with no striping
— it hard-caps aggregate bandwidth/IOPS regardless of how well the
application layer (num_workers, prefetch_factor, persistent_workers) is
tuned. This was confirmed directly on Tuolumne: a ScaFFold fractal dataset
sitting on NFS (`cz-ws2-nfs-new.llnl.gov`) showed critical `posix_*_ops_slope`
bottlenecks and only ~41% compute/I-O overlap even with L1-optimal
DataLoader settings; moving the same dataset to Lustre with matched striping
removed the ceiling entirely without any app-level code change.

**Before running any benchmark/training job**, check where the dataset
directory actually lives:
```bash
stat -f <dataset_dir>          # look for "Type: nfs" vs "Type: lustre"
df -T <dataset_dir>             # filesystem type column
```
If it's NFS, copy it to Lustre and repoint the app's data-dir argument —
do not proceed with performance analysis on an NFS-resident dataset, since
any I/O bottleneck found there may just be "wrong filesystem," not a real
app/library issue.

### Set Lustre striping to match the access pattern

Striping must be sized to the **actual per-file size and per-I/O transfer
size observed in the trace**, not applied blindly:

| Access pattern (from trace)                          | Stripe count            | Stripe size                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Many small files, each < stripe size (e.g. ML per-sample files, KB–few MB) | `1` — striping a tiny file across multiple OSTs adds overhead with no parallelism benefit; parallelism instead comes from many *files* being spread across the directory/filesystem | leave at filesystem default |
| Few large shared files (checkpoints, HDF5, single big dataset file) read/written by many ranks concurrently | OST count, capped 8 for < 1 GB files, 16+ for very large files | 1–4 MB, aligned to the app's read/write transfer size (see `dftracer_info`/diagnose `*_avg_transfer_size`) |
| Sequential large writes (checkpoints) | 4–8 | 4 MB (matches ROMIO `cb_buffer_size` default of 64 MB / 16 aggregators) |

Apply with `lfs setstripe -c <count> -S <size> <dir>` **before** any file is
created in that directory (striping is set at file-creation time and cannot
be changed retroactively without rewriting the file). For a directory of
many small per-sample files (the common ML dataset case), the correct call
is simply `lfs setstripe -c 1 <dataset_dir>` — do NOT default to a high
stripe count "for safety"; it actively hurts small-file access.

Verify after copying data in: `lfs getstripe -c <dataset_dir>` should report
the value you set, and `lfs getstripe <sample_file>` should show a single
OST for small-file datasets.

## Optimization Metric Selection Guide

Use this when the agent must suggest which metric to optimize:

| Dominant bottleneck(s)              | Recommended metric | Rationale                        |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| read_time_pct or write_time_pct ≥4  | time               | Latency is the binding constraint|
| read_bw_mean or write_bw_mean low   | bandwidth          | Throughput is the binding limit  |
| small_io_pct or rand_pct ≥4         | iops               | Operation rate limits throughput |
| metadata_time_pct ≥4                | metadata_ops       | Metadata is the bottleneck       |
| multiple ≥4                         | time (default)     | Most general; addresses all      |


## Common Parameter Recommendations (from WisIO + Drishti)

- **Buffer size:** 4 MB aligned to Lustre stripe size (1 MB default stripe)
- **ROMIO collective buffer:** 64 MB (`cb_buffer_size=67108864`)
- **Lustre stripe count:** 4–8 for files < 10 GB; 16+ for very large files
- **Linux readahead:** 2–8 MB (`blockdev --setra 4096` to `16384`)
- **DataLoader workers:** `cpu_count // 2` with `prefetch_factor=4`
- **PyTorch checkpoint:** async save in background thread; use lz4 compression
- **vm.dirty_ratio:** 10–20% for write-heavy; 5–10% for checkpoint workloads


## Artifact Files Produced by optimize.yaml

| File                        | Contents                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `optimization_context.json` | Metric, bottlenecks, papers — shared context |
| `opt_l1_results.json`       | L1 proposals, status, files modified         |
| `opt_l2_results.json`       | L2 proposals, env vars applied               |
| `opt_l2_env.sh`             | Source before each run to keep L2 settings   |
| `opt_l3_results.json`       | L3 changes + rollback commands               |
| `optimization_papers.json`  | Full literature search results               |

All artifact files above live under the current iteration's own `opt<n>/`
run directory (`opt<n>/source/`, `opt<n>/patches/`, `opt<n>/scripts/`,
`opt<n>/traces/{raw,compact}/`) — never a hand-built path like
`ws/opt_results/`. **Strict rule (see dftracer-cheatsheet S0):** before
starting a new iteration and again after applying L1/L2/L3 changes, call
`session_validate_structure(run_id=RUN_ID)`; if `clean=false`, call
`session_reorganize_structure(run_id=RUN_ID, dry_run=False)` before
re-running the smoke test or collecting traces for that iteration.

## Metric to Optimization Goal Mapping

Use this table to translate the chosen metric into the dftracer analysis fields that must improve:

| Metric        | Goal                        | Target dftracer fields                                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `time`        | Minimize I/O latency        | `read_time_pct`, `write_time_pct`, `metadata_time_pct`         |
| `bandwidth`   | Maximize throughput         | `read_bw_mean`, `write_bw_mean`, `seq_pct`                     |
| `iops`        | Maximize I/O operations/sec | `small_io_pct`, `rand_pct`, `intensity_mean`                   |
| `metadata_ops`| Reduce metadata overhead    | `metadata_time_pct`, `metadata_time_frac_parent`               |

When multiple bottleneck scores are >= 4, default to `time` as the most general metric that addresses all dimensions.


## L1 Application Strategies

These are source-code-level changes (applied under `<WS>/annotated/`). No system or middleware config changes at this layer.

### small_io / small_read / small_write  (metric: bandwidth or iops)

- Coalesce small reads into a single larger read with a staging buffer
- Replace per-element writes with batch writes to a pre-allocated buffer
- Use `readv`/`writev` (scatter/gather) instead of loops of `read`/`write`
- For Python: increase `chunk_size` in file iteration; use `np.fromfile` over loops

### rand / low seq_pct  (metric: bandwidth or time)

- Reorder access so items are read in file-offset order (sort indices before I/O)
- Add `posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL)` before sequential reads
- Use `mmap` for random access patterns to let the OS handle page faults
- For deep learning: sort dataset by file size, shuffle only indices in memory

### read_time / write_time  (metric: time)

- Pre-open files and keep file descriptors open across iterations
- Use `O_DIRECT` for cache-bypassing when data reuse is low
- Add async I/O: `io_uring` (C/C++) or `aiofiles`/`asyncio` (Python)
- Pre-allocate file size with `fallocate` before writing to avoid fragmentation

### metadata_time  (metric: metadata_ops)

- Cache `stat()` results; avoid repeated `lstat`/`stat` on the same paths
- Open files once per epoch, not once per sample
- Replace `readdir()` loops with pre-built file-list caches
- For Python: replace `os.path.exists()` in hot loops with `try`/`except`

### fetch_pressure / epoch_straggler  (metric: time or bandwidth — deep learning)

- Increase DataLoader `num_workers` (recommend: `cpu_count // 2`)
- Set `prefetch_factor=4` (PyTorch >= 1.7) or use `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`
- Pre-fetch next batch while compute runs the current one
- Use `persistent_workers=True` to avoid worker respawn overhead

### intensity / checkpoint  (metric: time)

- Write checkpoints asynchronously (background thread or process)
- Use memory-mapped files for checkpoint buffers before flushing to disk
- Compress checkpoints in-memory before writing (lz4 is fast enough)


## L2 Software/Middleware Strategies

These are configuration-level changes: environment variables, library hint files, and runtime config. No source code changes. All changes must be reversible (document the original value).

### MPI-IO / ROMIO  (bottleneck: small_io or rand_pct high — metric: bandwidth or time)

- Enable collective buffering: `ROMIO_HINTS=cb_buffer_size=67108864;romio_cb_read=enable`
- Set data sieving: `romio_ds_read=enable;romio_ds_write=enable`
- Increase aggregator count: `cb_nodes=<num_nodes>`
- Write a hints file at `<WS>/romio_hints.txt` and set the `ROMIO_HINTS` env var to its path

### HDF5  (bottleneck: small_io high — metric: bandwidth or iops)

- Set chunk dimensions to align with collective I/O buffer (e.g. 1 MB chunks)
- Enable HDF5 collective metadata: `H5Pset_coll_metadata_write`, `H5Pset_all_coll_metadata_ops`
- Set chunk cache: `H5Pset_cache(fapl, 0, 521, 64*1024*1024, 1.0)`
- For parallel HDF5: set PHDF5 alignment (`H5Pset_alignment`) to stripe size

### HDF5 metadata  (bottleneck: metadata_time high — metric: metadata_ops)

- Disable HDF5 metadata cache evictions during write-heavy phases
- Batch attribute writes with `H5Pset_object_track_times(False)`

### NetCDF / PnetCDF

- Set `nc_set_default_format(NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC)` for better performance
- Enable collective I/O: `nc_var_par_access(ncid, varid, NC_COLLECTIVE)`

### PyTorch / Deep Learning  (bottleneck: fetch_pressure or small_io high — metric: time or bandwidth)

- DataLoader: `num_workers = cpu_count // 2`, `prefetch_factor = 4`
- DataLoader: `pin_memory = True` (when GPU is present)
- DataLoader: `persistent_workers = True` (avoids respawn per epoch)
- For datasets: use `worker_init_fn` to pre-open file handles per worker
- `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128` (reduces alloc fragmentation)

### PyTorch epoch stragglers  (bottleneck: epoch_straggler high — metric: time)

- Sort dataset by sample size before training to reduce tail latency per batch
- Use `DistributedSampler` with `shuffle=False`; pre-shuffle indices once

### PyTorch checkpoints  (bottleneck: checkpoint high — metric: time)

- `torch.save` with `_use_new_zipfile_serialization=False` for faster writes
- Async checkpoint: `torch.save` in a separate thread
- Set `TORCH_HOME` to a fast local scratch directory

### TensorFlow

- `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` for prefetch buffer sizes
- `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` for interleave `cycle_length`
- Set `TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=1`, `TF_GPU_THREAD_MODE=gpu_private`

### General I/O libraries  (bottleneck: rand_pct high — metric: bandwidth)

- Set POSIX readahead: `POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL` via `posix_fadvise` (env-level wrapper)
- Configure library-level read-ahead buffer (if applicable)

### Environment variable wrapper script (general)

- `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS`: set to physical core count for I/O threading
- `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`: reduce glibc arena fragmentation for I/O-heavy apps
- `HBWMALLOC_POLICY=transparent`: use high-bandwidth NUMA memory when available
- Collect all L2 env vars in `<WS>/opt_l2_env.sh`; source before every run


## L3 OS/Filesystem Strategies

These are OS- and filesystem-level tuning changes. Many require `sudo` or storage-admin access. Every proposal MUST include a rollback command and a privilege classification (`no-sudo | sudo | admin-only`).

**MANDATORY: Before proposing any L3 strategy, confirm the detected FS_TYPE
(see Step 8-PRE of [[dftracer-pipeline]]). Only propose strategies whose
"Valid FS_TYPE" column matches the detected filesystem. Strategies for the
wrong filesystem are silently harmful — e.g., `romio_ds_write=disable` causes
a 4× write regression on VAST NVMe but is safe on Lustre spinning disk.**

### Lustre parallel filesystem  (FS_TYPE: lustre only — bottleneck: any_io or bandwidth — metric: bandwidth or iops)

- **Stripe count** (no sudo, per-directory):
  `lfs setstripe -c <N> <WS>/traces/`
  Rollback: `lfs setstripe -c 1 <WS>/traces/`
  Recommendation: N = OST count, capped at 8 for files < 1 GB; 16+ for very large files
- **Stripe size** (no sudo):
  `lfs setstripe -S 4m <WS>/traces/`  (4 MB aligns to ROMIO collective buffer)
  Rollback: `lfs setstripe -S 1m <WS>/traces/`
- **OST pool** (no sudo, if NVMe/SSD pool available):
  `lfs setstripe --pool flash <WS>/`
- **Per-file stripe before write** (no sudo):
  `lfs setstripe -c 4 -S 4m <WS>/traces/<file>` before writing

### Lustre metadata  (FS_TYPE: lustre only — bottleneck: metadata_time high — metric: metadata_ops)

- Disable file creation time tracking: `lfs setstripe --mdt-count 1` (for small dirs)
- Use DNE (Distributed Namespace): `lfs mkdir -c <N>` (admin-only)
- Client-side: mount with `-o localflock` to reduce lock traffic (requires remount — admin)

### Near-node flash accelerators (Rabbit)  (FS_TYPE: any network PFS — bottleneck: read_time/write_time/bandwidth from network-Lustre latency — metric: bandwidth or time)

On systems with node-local NVMe accelerators, stage hot data onto a per-node or
per-chassis flash tier instead of accessing network Lustre directly. No sudo —
provisioned per job via the scheduler.

- **Tuolumne (Rabbit):** request via Flux `-S "#DW jobdw type=<xfs|gfs2|lustre> ..."`.
  Pick the tier by data-sharing scope (SHM ≤20% node mem → XFS single-node ≤1 TB
  → GFS2 across ≤16 nodes on one chassis with `--coral2-chassis=1` → Lustre for
  >16 nodes). Stage input onto `$DW_JOB_*` once, run against it, copy persistent
  outputs back to Lustre at job end. The `#DW` directive is an **allocation-time**
  flag — ask the user to `flux alloc` with it and report the JOBID before you can
  proxy in. Full guide: [[system-tuolumne-rabbit]].


### Linux kernel readahead  (FS_TYPE: local_nvme, local_hdd only — bottleneck: read_time or seq_pct low — metric: time or bandwidth)

- **Per-device** (sudo):
  `sudo blockdev --setra <KB> /dev/<dev>`
  Default: 128 (64 KB); recommended: 4096–16384 (2–8 MB)
  Rollback: `sudo blockdev --setra 128 /dev/<dev>`
  Side effect: affects all processes reading from this device
- **Per-process** (no sudo — cross-layer L1 reinforcement):
  `posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL)` in source code
- **Persistent** (sudo): `/etc/udev/rules.d/60-readahead.rules`

### VM and page cache tuning  (FS_TYPE: local_nvme, local_hdd — bottleneck: write_time or checkpoint high — metric: time)

- `sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio=20`
  (flush dirty pages when 20% of RAM is dirty; tune to 10–40)
  Rollback: `sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio=20`
- `sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_background_ratio=5`
  (start background flush at 5%; reduces write stalls; default 10)
- `sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=3000` (30 s dirty page lifetime)
- `sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=500` (flush every 5 s)
- Side effect: affects all dirty-page behavior on the node

### VM page cache (read-heavy)  (FS_TYPE: local_nvme, local_hdd — bottleneck: read_time high, data fits in RAM)

- `sudo sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50`
  (reduce kernel tendency to reclaim page cache; default 100)
  Rollback: `sudo sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=100`

### I/O scheduler  (FS_TYPE: local_nvme, local_hdd only — bottleneck: rand_pct high on SSD/NVMe — metric: iops or time)

- Check current scheduler: `cat /sys/block/<dev>/queue/scheduler`
- For NVMe (no scheduler overhead): `echo none | sudo tee /sys/block/<dev>/queue/scheduler`
- For HDD: `echo mq-deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/<dev>/queue/scheduler`
- Rollback: `echo <original_scheduler> | sudo tee /sys/block/<dev>/queue/scheduler`

### NUMA memory binding  (FS_TYPE: all — bottleneck: fetch_pressure or intensity high — metric: time or bandwidth)

- Check topology: `numactl --hardware`
- Pin process to NUMA node with local memory (no persistent side effect):
  `numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 <run_command>`
- For MPI: `mpirun --map-by numa:pe=<cores_per_node>` (OpenMPI)

### Network filesystems (NFS, GPFS, BeeGFS)  (FS_TYPE: nfs | gpfs | beegfs only — bottleneck: read_time or metadata_time high)

These typically require storage admin action — surface as MANUAL RECOMMENDATIONS only.
Do NOT apply these to lustre, vast, or local filesystems.
- NFS: mount with `rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,async`
- GPFS: `mmchattr -r pagePool=<size>` (admin tool)
- BeeGFS: `beegfs-ctl --settuning --clientNumWorkerThreads=16` (admin)


## Citation Rule

Every optimization proposal presented to the user MUST include a verifiable citation with a URL (arXiv link, DOI, or stable webpage). Follow this search order for each unique bottleneck type:

1. Check `PAPERS` from `optimization_context.json` first (already fetched during pipeline setup).
2. Search arXiv: `dftracer__search_arxiv(query="<bottleneck_type> optimization HPC parallel I/O MPI", max_results=5, category="cs.DC")`
3. Search Semantic Scholar / combined: `dftracer__search_papers_combined(query="<bottleneck_type> I/O tuning parallel filesystem", max_results=5)`
4. For any promising arXiv hit, fetch the full record: `dftracer__get_arxiv_paper(paper_id="<arxiv_id>")`

For every citation record:
- authors, title, venue/journal, year
- URL: arXiv link, DOI, or page URL (e.g. `https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX`)
- the specific finding or section that supports the proposed change (1–2 sentences)

**If no verifiable citation with a URL can be found for a proposal, that proposal MUST be skipped.** Do not present uncited proposals to the user. Instead, write "no L\<N\> fix — no citation available" for that bottleneck.

## Start from what is already known

Before proposing anything, load [[dftracer-optimization-kb]] and call:

```
opt_kb_lookup(system=<system>, workload=<app>, software="hdf5,mpi-io,lustre")
```

It returns MEASURED cross-session results, partitioned into system-centric (L3),
software-centric (L2) and workload-centric (L1) findings, each with its citation,
before/after numbers and caveats. Scope decides transferability: a system finding
does not leave its machine; a workload finding does not leave its app; software
findings travel across both.

Then render proposals with `opt_proposal_table` (uncited proposals are rejected),
apply **one at a time**, measure, and `opt_kb_record` every result — including
no-ops and regressions. Finish with `opt_kb_render` to publish into the KB skill.

## Context economy: query the graph, don't read the tree

Before any step that would open source files, use the `graphify` knowledge graph
(project dependency `graphifyy`, CLI `graphify`):

```bash
graphify query "<target>" --budget 1200   # locate: NODE <sym> [src=file loc=Lnn]
graphify explain <symbol>                 # definition + callers/callees
graphify affected <symbol> --depth 2      # blast radius before you change it
graphify update .                         # refresh after edits (~4s, no LLM)
```

Measured on this repo: locating cost 986 tokens vs 29,456 to read the three
relevant files (3.3%). Run `affected` before editing any shared function and
state the blast radius. Use the CLI, never `graphify-mcp` — its extra tool
schemas would sit in context permanently. See [[dftracer-context-economy]].

## Optimization axes for deep-learning workloads (sweep in this order)

1. **Overlap compute and I/O.** `dataloader_num_workers>0`, `persistent_workers=True`,
   `prefetch_factor`, async checkpointing. Cheapest, usually the biggest win.
   (Mohan et al., *Analyzing and Mitigating Data Stalls in DNN Training*, VLDB 2021,
   https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06775)
2. **Pinned memory + CPU core affinity — as ONE change.** `pin_memory=True` only pays off when
   each rank is bound to all cores of its GPU's die. Pinned to a single core, the copy thread
   contends with dataloader workers and the benefit inverts. On an APU (e.g. AMD MI300A) CPU and
   GPU share the die and HBM, so affinity determines memory locality, not just scheduling.
   (PyTorch memory-pinning docs, https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#memory-pinning)
3. **File layout: minimize the NUMBER of reads and metadata calls.** Per-sample small files cause
   an open/stat/close storm on the metadata server. Shard into few large files with an index.
   (Devarajan et al., *DLIO: A Data-Centric Benchmark for Scientific Deep Learning Applications*,
   CCGrid 2021, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499416)
4. **System utilization.** PFS bandwidth (striping; Data-on-MDT for small files) and memory
   bandwidth. Establish whether you are bandwidth- or compute-bound before tuning kernels.
   (Williams et al., *Roofline: An Insightful Visual Performance Model*, CACM 2009,
   https://doi.org/10.1145/1498765.1498785)
5. **Compute last.** Mixed precision, kernel/library tuning, then algorithmic change.

**Async checkpointing** is only a win when checkpoint write time is a real fraction of epoch
time — verify first. (Mohan et al., *CheckFreq*, USENIX FAST 2021,
https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/mohan; Eisenman et al., *Check-N-Run*,
USENIX NSDI 2022, https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi22/presentation/eisenman)

**Guard rail.** A wall-clock gain from writing fewer checkpoints, reading less data, or running
fewer epochs is *doing less*, not going faster. Check event and byte counts before crediting it.

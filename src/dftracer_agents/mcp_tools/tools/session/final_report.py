"""Assemble a self-contained ``final_report/`` deliverable for a session.

A dftracer session accumulates its evidence in many places: annotated sources,
per-iteration run directories, wrapper scripts under ``tmp/``, logs under
``artifacts/``, and a living ``pipeline_plan.md``. Reproducing the study later
(or handing it to a colleague) means re-deriving all of that by hand.

``session_final_report`` collapses it into one folder:

.. code-block:: text

    final_report/
      README.md               ← how to reproduce the session manually
      REPORT.md               ← what was done, results, root cause
      CONVERSATION.md         ← narrative walkthrough of how we got there
      PERFORMANCE.md          ← what the AGENT PIPELINE cost: per-step time,
                                retries, tokens, USD (from performance/)
      performance/
        performance_report.md     ← the same report, with its supporting data
        summary.json              ← whole-run profile snapshot
        steps/<n>-<step>.json     ← one file per pipeline step
        mlflow.json               ← experiment / parent-run / UI deep link
      plan/
        pipeline_plan.md          ← the final plan that was executed
        pipeline_plan_changelog.md
        plan_evolution.diff       ← how the plan changed vs its first version
      patches/
        annotated.patch           ← baseline/source  → annotated/source
        opt<n>.patch              ← previous run     → opt<n> (source + config)
        opt<n>.config.diff        ← flash.par / run-script deltas
      scripts/
        install.sh                ← rebuild deps + app for every case
        run_<case>.sh             ← one runner per case (baseline, opt1..optN)
        run_all.sh                ← run every case in order
      logs/                       ← the run/build logs each case referenced

Everything written is derived from what is already on disk — the tool never
re-runs the application.

    Persists, under ``<ws>/<run_name>/record/``, everything the final report
    will later need but which is otherwise lost when the next iteration
    overwrites it in place:

    * ``build_config/`` — ``object/setup_call``, ``object/Units``,
      ``object/Makefile.h``. The decisive optimization on Make-based apps lives
      here (serial vs parallel IO unit), and a source diff cannot see it.
    * ``params/`` — the run's parameter file(s). Apps like Flash-X always read a
      fixed filename (``flash.par``) from cwd, so each iteration overwrites it;
      without a snapshot only the last iteration's config survives.
    * ``scripts/run.sh`` — the exact wrapper used for this run.
    * ``meta.json`` — run name, timestamps, notes, and the captured file list.

    The run log is copied into ``artifacts/<run_name>_run.log`` so that every log
    lives under ``artifacts/`` rather than scattered across ``tmp/``.

    When *prev_run_name* is given, a ``patches/from_<prev>.record.diff`` is
    written capturing the build-config / params / script deltas — i.e. exactly
    what changed between the two iterations.

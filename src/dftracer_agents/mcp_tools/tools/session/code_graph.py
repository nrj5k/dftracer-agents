"""Knowledge-graph access for agents: locate code instead of reading it.

The dominant token cost in this pipeline is *input* — source an agent reads to
orient itself. ``graphify`` builds a tree-sitter graph over C/C++/Fortran/Python
plus markdown headings, so an agent can ask "where is X" and get
``file:line`` back for ~200 tokens instead of ~30,000.

Two graphs, two lifetimes:

* **knowledge graph** — this package's own code + its skills and agent
  definitions. Answers "where is the cost gate enforced", "what breaks if I
  change ``recommend()``".
* **session graph** — the target application being annotated/optimized, built
  inside that session's workspace. Answers the same questions about Flash-X or
  ScaFFold without reading 2600 files.

Deployment constraints this module works around (all measured, none guessable):

1. ``graphify`` writes its output to ``<scanned_path>/graphify-out`` and offers
   no ``--out`` flag. Scanning the installed package would therefore drop build
   artefacts inside ``site-packages``, which ``pip uninstall`` never removes. So
   we scan a **staged copy** under ``<workspaces_root>/_graph/`` instead.
2. ``graphify`` does **not** follow symlinked directories — a staged symlink
   tree yields "No code files found". The stage must contain real files.
3. A markdown-only tree also yields no graph; markdown is only extracted when
   code files are present in the same tree. So the stage carries both.
5. ``graphify`` honours ``.gitignore``. The cache lives under ``workspaces/``,
   which this repo gitignores, so scanning it reports "No code files found". A
   ``.graphifyignore`` at the scan root re-includes it (last-match-wins, same
   semantics as gitignore); ``_ensure_graphifyignore`` maintains that file.
4. Skills are self-updating: agents record lessons into them at runtime. The
   graph therefore rots. Freshness is keyed on a content hash of the staged
   inputs, plus a dirty flag any writer can set.

A rebuild costs ~4 s with no LLM and no API key, so the hash check is the
expensive-looking part that is actually free.

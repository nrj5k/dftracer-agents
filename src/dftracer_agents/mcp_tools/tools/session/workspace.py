"""
Workspace helpers, subprocess runner, and response utilities for the dftracer
MCP session pipeline.

This module provides the foundational building blocks shared by every pipeline
stage (detect, build, install, run, …).  It owns three orthogonal concerns:

1. **Workspace layout** — every pipeline "run" gets an isolated directory tree
   rooted at ``$DFTRACER_WORKSPACES/<app_name>/<run_id>/``.  State is persisted
   as ``session.json`` inside that directory so that any MCP tool can resume a
   run across multiple calls.

2. **Subprocess execution** — a single :func:`_run` wrapper normalises stdout,
   stderr, return-code, and timeout handling into a uniform ``dict`` that every
   tool can pattern-match on.

3. **MCP response serialisation** — :func:`_ok` and :func:`_err` produce
   JSON-encoded response strings in the shape that MCP callers expect.

All public symbols are *private by convention* (``_``-prefixed) because they
are internal helpers imported by sibling modules, not exposed through the MCP
tool registry directly.  The ``DFTRACER_WORKSPACES`` environment variable
controls the root directory; it defaults to ``./workspaces`` relative to the
current working directory when the process starts.

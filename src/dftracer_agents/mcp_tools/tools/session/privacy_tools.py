"""MCP tools for privacy validation of everything this package persists.

Memory, lessons, skills and agent definitions are git-tracked and ship to other
people. We learn from experience but never record *who* ran it. These tools let
an agent scan those trees for identifying content and redact it deterministically
rather than eyeballing prose.

* :func:`privacy_scan`   — report identifying content; never writes.
* :func:`privacy_redact` — rewrite the offending files in place.

Both default to the persisted trees (``.agents/skills``, ``.agents/agents``,
``.agents/workspace``). A live session workspace under ``workspaces/<session>/``
is gitignored and intentionally NOT scanned: it holds real resolved paths a run
needs.

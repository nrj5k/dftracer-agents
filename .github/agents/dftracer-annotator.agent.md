## Load your skills first (MANDATORY)

Before anything else, load this agent's skills through the dftracer MCP server:

```
skill_load(name="dftracer-context-economy,dftracer-annotate-project,dftracer-annotate-general,dftracer-annotation-lessons,dftracer-cheatsheet,dftracer-profiling")
```

## Load your plan section first (do this before anything else)

The pipeline planner has written a detailed, self-contained plan into the
session at `pipeline_plan.md`. Do NOT replan — execute what it says.
1. `session_read_file(run_id=<run_id>, subfolder=".", filepath="pipeline_plan.md")`
   (fall back to `subfolder="scripts"` if the main thread says so).
2. Find the `## STEP N: <this-agent-name>` section for THIS agent and follow it
   verbatim: tools, exact inputs, commands, expected artifacts, and gotchas are
   already resolved there.
3. If the section is missing or contradicts the inputs you were dispatched with,
   report that back to the main thread instead of guessing.

## Tool-First Annotation Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use MCP tools first.** Before any manual file editing or custom Bash commands,
attempt every relevant MCP tool in this order:

1. `mcp__dftracer__session_identify_smoke_test_files` — identify smoke test files for scoping
2. `mcp__dftracer__clang_annotate_project` — annotate entire project at once
3. `mcp__dftracer__clang_annotate_file` — annotate a single file
4. `mcp__dftracer__clang_extract_functions` — extract function map
5. `mcp__dftracer__clang_estimate_function_cost` — estimate function cost for hot-loop exclusion
6. `mcp__dftracer__clang_syntax_check` — verify annotated file compiles
7. `mcp__dftracer__clang_lint_annotations` — lint annotation correctness
8. `mcp__dftracer__clang_add_braces` — add braces for RAII safety
9. `mcp__dftracer__clang_insert_line` — insert annotation macros at specific lines
10. `mcp__dftracer__clang_write_annotated_file` — write annotated file back
11. `mcp__dftracer__session_annotation_report` — get annotation coverage report
12. `mcp__dftracer__session_get_run_paths` — get canonical paths for the session

If the tools are not available, stop and ask the user to start the dftracer MCP server.
If the tools are available but error, fix the tool or its wiring and apply the fix before
using custom Bash commands.

You annotate ONE session's source and validate it, then stop.

## Load first (mandatory) — these skills ARE your rules

Load each and follow it directly; do not rely on a summary here, because the
skills are updated as the pipeline runs and this file is not.
  General/C/C++/Python Pitfalls (PG/PC/CP/PP) and Core Annotation Rules.
  accumulated real pitfalls (multi-line-if brace bug, stale `_FILE_CACHE`,
  hot-loop trace noise, etc.). Apply every entry that matches.
  (CC1–CC7), and Known Mistakes.

Also load the project-annotation skill before any file discovery:
`skill_load(name="dftracer-annotate-project")`

Route C, C++, and Python files to the matching file-type subagent. Keep this
project-level agent focused on discovery, scoping, and validation.

Govern your work by those skills. In particular the clang-tools-only rule, the
per-function re-annotate/revert-to-PENDING recovery, the stale-cache flush, and
hot-loop `exclude_functions` all live in the skills above — read them there, do
not act on memory.

## Steps

1. If given a smoke command, `session_identify_smoke_test_files` to scope,
   and REPORT the file list + which binary needs each before annotating.
2. `clang_annotate_project` (or per-file for scoped sets).
3. `clang_syntax_check` + `clang_lint_annotations` on every annotated file;
   fix per the rules above.
4. `session_annotation_report` and return: files annotated, functions
   annotated/skipped, any PENDING reverted files.
5. Before stopping, write any new annotation pitfall into the sibling lesson
  files immediately.

## Self-learning: feed lessons back into skills (mandatory — before you stop)

This is a required self-learning step for EVERY agent, not optional. Whenever
you discover something non-obvious — a build/run caveat, an environment quirk,
a pitfall and its exact fix — record it in the RIGHT skill so the whole system
learns next time. Choose the skill by scope, and create it if it does not exist:
- App/workload-specific → `workload-<app>` skill (e.g. `workload-flashx`).
- System / site / environment-specific → `system-<system>` skill (e.g. `system-tuolumne`).
- Library / software-specific (HDF5, MPI, ROMIO, compilers, …) → `software-<lib>` skill.

How: `skill_load` the target skill to read its current SKILL.md, then append a
dated one-line lesson in the form `symptom → root cause → exact fix`. Keep it
terse and de-duplicated (don't restate an existing lesson). Edit the skill's
`SKILL.md` at its resolved path under the skills directory; for a brand-new
skill, create `<skills-dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` with a short frontmatter + the
lesson. If you genuinely learned nothing new, say so explicitly in your report.

**Skill vs MCP tool (self-learning routing):** a corner case or fact → a skill (above).
GENERIC programmatic logic that should run the same way every time → add or fix an MCP
tool under `src/dftracer_agents/mcp_tools/` (then ask the user to restart the server), not
just prose. Grow both the skills and the tools.

**Living plan + logs:** after your step, update the downstream `## STEP N:` sections of
`pipeline_plan.md` with any concrete facts you resolved and append a dated line to
`pipeline_plan_changelog.md` (what changed + why). Write EVERY log you produce (saved Bash
output, build/run logs, scratch) under `<WS>/artifacts/`, never elsewhere.

**Persist new learning to the agent definition too (always).** Anything you discover
that is NOT already captured must be written down so it survives the session — in BOTH:
1. the relevant skill (knowledge / corner case), AND
2. THIS agent's own definition file `src/dftracer_agents/.agents/agents/<this-agent>.yaml`
   whenever the lesson changes how the agent should behave next time (a new pre-check,
   step, guard, default, or gotcha). After editing an agent definition, re-render (`agents_sync` MCP tool) and ask the user to reload.
Generic, deterministic programmatic logic still becomes an MCP tool. New learning never
lives only in your head — skill + agent definition (+ MCP tool when generic), every time.

## Self-learning confirmation gate (MANDATORY — overrides "record immediately")

Capture learning aggressively, persist it safely:

1. **Always propose skill updates.** Before you stop, actively record what you
   did this session so future sessions reuse it — not only failures, but the
   working recipe: exact commands, flags, paths, versions, and any caveat you
   hit. Every agent is expected to grow the skills every run.
2. **Route generic vs specific correctly.**
   - Reusable, cross-workload knowledge -> the relevant GENERIC skill
     (keep those skills generic).
   - App-specific caveats -> `workload-<app>`; site/env quirks ->
     `system-<system>`; library specifics (HDF5/MPI/compiler) ->
     `software-<lib>`. Create the specific skill if it does not exist.
   - Prefer generic skills to hold the general procedure and the specific
     skills to hold only the workload/system/software deltas.
3. **Confirmation gate — do NOT self-write.** Do NOT edit skills, lesson files,
   agent definitions, or MCP tools yourself. Instead PROPOSE each update in your
   final summary as: target (which skill/tool/agent) -> symptom/what-you-did ->
   root cause (if a fix) -> exact content to add. The main thread confirms the
   observation with the user, and only then is anything persisted. This prevents
   incorrect diagnoses from polluting shared skills/tools/agents and supersedes
   any "record ... immediately in the sibling lesson files" instruction above.

## Logs go to `artifacts/` (MANDATORY)

Every log you produce — build output, run stdout/stderr, saved Bash output,
scratch diagnostics — is written under the session's `<WS>/artifacts/`
directory. Never leave a log only in the terminal, and never write logs to
`<WS>/tmp/` (that directory is for wrapper scripts and scratch inputs) or
anywhere outside the session workspace. Name them `<step>_<what>.log` so the
final report can collect them.

## Capture the run record before you finish (MANDATORY)

Optimization iterations overwrite build config, the parameter file, and the run
wrapper **in place**, so that information is gone by the time the final report is
assembled. At the END of your step, once the run has succeeded, call:

```
session_capture_run_record(
    run_id=<run_id>,
    run_name="<annotated|baseline|opt1|opt2|...>",
    prev_run_name="<previous run, for the delta>",
    source_path="<WS>/annotated/source",
    run_script="<path to the wrapper you launched>",
    run_log="<WS>/artifacts/<run>_run.log",
    param_files="flash.par",        # or the app's parameter file(s)
    notes="what this iteration changed and why",
)
```

This snapshots `build_config/` (`setup_call`, `Units`, `Makefile.h` — where the
decisive change lives on Make-based apps, invisible to a source diff), the
parameter file(s), the run script, and writes
`patches/from_<prev>.record.diff`. Also call `session_snapshot_run_source` when
the run has its own source tree.

Without this, `session_final_report` cannot reconstruct what your iteration did.
Assemble the deliverable at the end of the pipeline with `session_final_report`.

## Mandatory final validation gate (ALWAYS — even after manual fixes)

After ALL per-language annotation subagents finish — and after any manual repair
you or they performed — dispatch the matching validator for every language
present in the tree, and only then hand off to the build step:

| Language | Validator agent |
| --- | --- |
| C | `dftracer-validate-c` |
| C++ | `dftracer-validate-cpp` |
| Python | `dftracer-validate-python` |

Equivalently, call `validate_annotations(run_id, language=<lang>)` per language.

This runs unconditionally: whether the clang/python MCP tools succeeded, partly
failed, or were bypassed for hand edits. A tool failure followed by a manual fix
is the highest-risk path in the whole pipeline, not a reason to skip the check.

**Do not mark the annotation stage complete until every language validates with
`passed: true`.** Report unresolved findings verbatim and escalate.

## Context economy — locate, don't read (MANDATORY)

The dominant token cost is **input**: source you read to orient yourself. This
repo ships `graphify` (dep `graphifyy`), a tree-sitter knowledge graph over
C/C++/Fortran/Python. Query it instead of reading files.

```
graph_query(question="<what you are looking for>", budget=1200)  # -> NODE <sym> [src=file loc=Lnn]
graph_query(mode="explain",  symbol="<symbol>")                  # definition + callers/callees
graph_query(mode="affected", symbol="<symbol>", depth=2)         # blast radius of a change
graph_ensure(run_id=RUN_ID)                                      # build the target app's graph
```

Measured here: locating via the graph cost **986 tokens** where reading the three
relevant files cost **29,456** (3.3%). `explain`/`affected` cost ~210 each.

**Rules**

1. **Locate before you read.** Do not `grep`/`Read` a tree to find where something
   lives. Ask the graph, then open only the `file:line` it names.
2. **Before editing any shared function, run `graphify affected <fn> --depth 2`**
   and state the blast radius. A "local" fix that silently breaks a caller is the
   failure this prevents.
3. **Freshness is automatic** — the graph rebuilds when skills/agents/code change
   (~5 s) and costs ~0.1 s to validate otherwise. Force with `graph_ensure(force=True)`.
4. **Budget queries** (`--budget 1200`); BFS pulls in generic nodes (`_ok`, `json`)
   — ignore them rather than widening.
5. **Use `graph_query`/`graph_ensure`** (two thin tools that guarantee freshness),
   never graphify's own MCP server — its ~25 schemas would sit in context
   permanently on top of this project's 137 dftracer tools. The `graphify` CLI is
   a fallback, but it does not check freshness.

Load [[dftracer-context-economy]] for the full rationale and limits.

## Step Profiling (MANDATORY)

This pipeline profiles itself. Bracket your entire execution with the profile
tools, using the plan's `## STEP N: <agent-name>` heading verbatim as `step`:

```
profile_step_begin(step="STEP N: dftracer-annotator", agent="dftracer-annotator", notes="<diagnostic detail>")
... your work ...
profile_step_end(step="STEP N: dftracer-annotator", status="ok")
```

If you fail and retry, close the attempt with the real reason and reopen with the
SAME `step` string — that records a retry rather than a new step:

```
profile_step_end(step="STEP N: dftracer-annotator", status="failed", error="<what broke>")
profile_step_begin(step="STEP N: dftracer-annotator", agent="dftracer-annotator")
```

Never call `profile_bind` — that is the orchestrator's job. Never report
`status="ok"` for a step that did not succeed; the report's Rework section is the
whole point. Load [[dftracer-profiling]] for the full rules.

## Use the Knowledge Graph Before Reading Files (MANDATORY)

You have `graph_query` and `graph_ensure`. Use them to LOCATE code instead of
reading or grepping whole files:

```
graph_ensure(run_id=RUN_ID)                                      # build the app's graph
graph_query(question="<what you are looking for>", budget=1200)  # -> NODE <sym> [src=file loc=Lnn]
graph_query(mode="explain",  symbol="<symbol>")                  # definition + callers/callees
graph_query(mode="affected", symbol="<symbol>", depth=2)         # blast radius before editing
```

Open only the files the graph names. Run `mode="affected"` before editing any
shared function and state the blast radius. Load [[dftracer-context-economy]] for
the full rationale.

## Redact Before You Persist (MANDATORY)

Skills, lessons, agent definitions and memory are git-tracked and ship to other
people. We learn from experience; we never record who ran it. Before writing to
any of them, strip: usernames and real names, emails, absolute user paths
(`/usr/WS2/<user>/...`, `/p/lustre5/<user>/...`, `/g/g92/<user>/...`), flux job
ids, session UUIDs, node hostnames. Write `$USER`, `$PROJECT_ROOT`,
`$LUSTRE_ROOT`, `$HOME`, `<flux-jobid>`, `<uuid>`, `<system><node>` instead.
Keep the lesson; drop the provenance. Citation lines are exempt.

A live session workspace under `workspaces/<session>/` is gitignored and keeps
its real paths — this rule applies to the persisted trees, not to it.

Verify deterministically with `privacy_scan()` rather than by reading. The
`dftracer-privacy-guard` agent is the end-of-session backstop, not your excuse.
Load [[dftracer-privacy-guard]].

## Environment consistency (MANDATORY, applies to every step)

The application defines the environment, not the site defaults. Before touching modules,
compilers, or a venv, read the app's own scripts and reuse them VERBATIM:
`<app>/scripts/install-<system>.sh`, `<app>/scripts/<app>-<system>.job`, `pyproject.toml`.

- **install env == run env.** Same python, modules, `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, patchelf steps.
- **Install dftracer in the SAME script and venv as the app** (critical for DL workloads,
  whose torch/mpi4py wheels pin an exact MPI/ROCm/Python ABI).
- **Bind `CC`/`CXX` to the MPI the app uses.** `which mpicc` may be the wrong wrapper; linking
  dftracer against a different MPI than the app preloads aborts at exit (`double free`).
- Pass MPI (and HDF5 only if the app uses it) explicitly to dftracer via ENV VARS.
- A zero exit code does not mean tracing worked. Verify `python -c "import dftracer.dftracer"`
  and that a NON-EMPTY `.pfw` was produced.

See the `dftracer-install` skill, RULE 0-5.

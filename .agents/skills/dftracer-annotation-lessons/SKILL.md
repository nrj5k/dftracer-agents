description: >
  Lessons learned from dftracer annotation sessions — real errors, root causes,
  and exact fixes. Loaded by each per-file annotation subagent at startup.
  Updated by the pipeline recipe after every session (Step 8).

## How to use this file

Read this before annotating any file. For each lesson:
  1. Check if the `context` matches what you are about to do
  2. If so, apply the `fix` proactively — do not repeat the mistake

## How to add new entries

The pipeline recipe (Step 8) appends new entries after each session.
Entries follow this format:

```
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
app: <git url>
context: <one-line description of what was being attempted>
error: |
  <exact error message or key excerpt>
root_cause: <why it happened>
fix: |
  <exact steps or rule that resolved it>
tags: [<language>, annotation, <error-keyword>]
---
```

Do not delete old entries. Entries accumulate as institutional memory.

## Standing rules (always apply, every session)

These are not lessons from failures — they are invariants that must hold:

R1  Read the lessons file before annotating any file (you are doing that now).

R2  Write the COMPLETE file when calling session_write_file. Never a partial.
    Verify: written line count > original line count.

R3  Run coverage verification after every file before moving to the next.
    START/decorator count must equal comp= count.

R4  Never annotate a forward declaration (C/C++: a line ending with ";").
    For any function name found twice, annotate only the definition (has body).

R5  Never annotate a header file (.h / .hpp).
    Put #include <dftracer/dftracer.h> in .c / .cpp files only.

R6  Lifecycle functions (*_init, *_final, *_initialize, *_finalize) are always
    annotated regardless of body length — never apply Rule 0 skip to them.

R7  Vendor filesystem functions (gpfs_*, beegfs_*, lustre_*, hdfs_*, ceph_*,
    daos_*) are always annotated as comp="io".

R8  If annotated code contains explicit DFTRACER_C_INIT() / DFTRACER_CPP_INIT()
    / DFTracer.initialize_log() calls, the environment must have DFTRACER_INIT=0
    when running the binary. Setting DFTRACER_INIT=1 with explicit INIT calls
    produces an empty trace file with no events.

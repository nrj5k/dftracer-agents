description: >
  Lessons learned from dftracer annotation sessions — real errors, root causes,
  and exact fixes. Loaded by each per-file annotation subagent at startup.
  Updated by the pipeline recipe after every session (Step 8).

## How to use this file

Read this before annotating any file. For each lesson:
  1. Check if the `context` matches what you are about to do
  2. If so, apply the `fix` proactively — do not repeat the mistake

## How to add new entries

The pipeline recipe (Step 8) appends new entries after each session.
Entries follow this format:

```
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
app: <git url>
context: <one-line description of what was being attempted>
error: |
  <exact error message or key excerpt>
root_cause: <why it happened>
fix: |
  <exact steps or rule that resolved it>
tags: [<language>, annotation, <error-keyword>]
---
```

Do not delete old entries. Entries accumulate as institutional memory.

## Standing rules (always apply, every session)

These are not lessons from failures — they are invariants that must hold:

R1  Read the lessons file before annotating any file (you are doing that now).

R2  Write the COMPLETE file when calling session_write_file. Never a partial.
    Verify: written line count > original line count.

R3  Run coverage verification after every file before moving to the next.
    START/decorator count must equal comp= count.

R4  Never annotate a forward declaration (C/C++: a line ending with ";").
    For any function name found twice, annotate only the definition (has body).

R5  Never annotate a header file (.h / .hpp).
    Put #include <dftracer/dftracer.h> in .c / .cpp files only.

R6  Lifecycle functions (*_init, *_final, *_initialize, *_finalize) are always
    annotated regardless of body length — never apply Rule 0 skip to them.

R7  Vendor filesystem functions (gpfs_*, beegfs_*, lustre_*, hdfs_*, ceph_*,
    daos_*) are always annotated as comp="io".

R8  If annotated code contains explicit DFTRACER_C_INIT() / DFTRACER_CPP_INIT()
    / DFTracer.initialize_log() calls, the environment must have DFTRACER_INIT=0
    when running the binary. Setting DFTRACER_INIT=1 with explicit INIT calls
    produces an empty trace file with no events.

context: Inserting DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_END into braceless single-line if (dryRun pattern)
error: |
  Inserting END made the early return unconditional — dryRun check bypassed.
  Or: compiler error "expected ';' before DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_END"
root_cause: C braceless-if shares its body with the first following statement.
  END inserted before the return stole the if body, making return fall through always.
fix: |
  Grep for braceless early-exit lines before annotating each file:
    grep -n "if.*return\|if.*continue\|if.*break" <file.c> | grep -v "{" | grep -v "//"
  For each hit, add explicit braces FIRST, then insert END:
    // Before: if (dryRun) return NULL;
    // After:
    if (dryRun) {
      DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_END();
      return NULL;
    }

context: DFTRACER_C_FINI placed before ior_main() call — all backend spans missing from trace
error: |
  Trace contains only the main() span. No POSIX_Create, MPIIO_Open, HDF5_Close
  or any other backend spans appear even though those functions are annotated.
root_cause: |
  DFTRACER_C_FINI() was placed just before the final return in main(), BEFORE
  ior_main() had been called. dftracer finalized and stopped recording; all backend
  I/O that ran inside ior_main() was untraced.
fix: |
  FINI must appear AFTER the top-level benchmark function returns. Structure:
    int main(...) {
      MPI_Init(...);
      DFTRACER_C_INIT(NULL, NULL, NULL);
      DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_START();
      ...
      ior_main(opts);           // ← real I/O happens here
      DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_END();
      DFTRACER_C_FINI();        // ← AFTER ior_main, not before the benchmark call
      MPI_Finalize();
      return 0;
    }
  Before placing FINI, identify the "benchmark call" in main() — the call that
  does all the real work — and ensure FINI comes after it returns.

context: HDF5 stray END inserted because grep matched forward declaration instead of definition
error: |
  HDF5_Create had a DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_END() inserted before DFTRACER_C_FUNCTION_START()
  — compile error or incorrect trace span.
root_cause: |
  grep matched the forward declaration of HDF5_Create (which ends with ';')
  and inserted an END there, then also annotated the real definition.
fix: |
  Always filter grep results to definitions only:
    grep -n "HDF5_Create" file.c | grep -v ";$"
  The definition has a body ({...}); the forward declaration ends with ';'.
  Annotate ONLY the definition line, never the declaration.

context: dftracer built without MPI/HDF5 support — MPIIO and HDF5 annotation not captured
error: |
  Trace files exist but contain only POSIX events. MPIIO_* and HDF5_* annotated
  function spans are missing even though the annotations compiled correctly.
root_cause: |
  dftracer was installed without -DDFTRACER_ENABLE_MPI=ON and -DDFTRACER_ENABLE_HDF5=ON.
  The config header shows DFTRACER_MPI_ENABLE 0. Without MPI support, dftracer
  cannot intercept MPI-IO paths and MPI-aware annotations produce no events.
fix: |
  Rebuild dftracer with backend flags:
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> \
          -DDFTRACER_ENABLE_MPI=ON \
          -DDFTRACER_ENABLE_HDF5=ON \
          -DDFTRACER_ENABLE_FTRACING=ON <src>
    make -j4 install
  Verify: grep DFTRACER_MPI_ENABLE <prefix>/include/dftracer/core/dftracer_config.hpp
  Expected output: #define DFTRACER_MPI_ENABLE 1
  Then do a clean rebuild of the annotated project against the new dftracer install.

context: IOR autotools configure silently ignored new --with-hdf5 flag due to stale state
error: |
  ./configure --with-hdf5 completed without error but config.h showed USE_HDF5_AIORI=0.
  The HDF5 backend was not compiled in.
root_cause: |
  Stale .deps/, config.status, and autom4te.cache from a previous ./configure run
  caused autotools to skip re-detection of HDF5. The new --with-hdf5 flag was
  effectively ignored.
fix: |
  Before reconfiguring after any flag change:
    make distclean
    rm -rf .deps src/.deps autom4te.cache config.status config.log Makefile
  Then set HDF5 paths via env and use bare --with-hdf5 (no path argument):
    export CPPFLAGS="-I${HDF5_PREFIX}/include"
    export LDFLAGS="-L${HDF5_PREFIX}/lib -Wl,-rpath,${HDF5_PREFIX}/lib"
    export LIBS="-lhdf5 -lz"
    ./configure --with-hdf5 --prefix=<install_prefix> ...
  Verify: grep USE_HDF5_AIORI config.h → should show 1

context: OpenMPI refuses to run as root in a container environment
error: |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are components in the Open MPI that should not be run as root.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
root_cause: |
  The container runs as uid=0. OpenMPI's default policy refuses to launch
  as root as a safety measure.
fix: |
  Add --allow-run-as-root to mpirun and set the two confirm env vars:
    OMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT=1 OMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT_CONFIRM=1 \
      mpirun -np 1 --allow-run-as-root ./src/ior -a MPIIO ...
  When using session_run_with_dftracer, pass via env_extra:
    {"OMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT": "1", "OMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT_CONFIRM": "1"}

app: general
context: Running dftracer trace collection — always use DFTRACER_DATA_DIR=all and start dftracer_service daemon
error: |
  (not an error — a standing best-practice from IOR session experience)
root_cause: |
  Using a scoped DFTRACER_DATA_DIR (e.g., workspace/source) silently drops I/O events
  on /tmp, /scratch, or other paths where benchmarks actually write data.
  Not running dftracer_service means only inline annotation spans are captured,
  missing system-level I/O that the daemon would have recorded.
fix: |
  In the pipeline trace run (Step 7):
  1. Always pass data_dir="all" to session_run_with_dftracer.
     This sets DFTRACER_DATA_DIR=all so no I/O path is excluded.
  2. Start dftracer_service before the run and stop it after:
       SERVICE_BIN=<WS>/install_ann/bin/dftracer_service
       SERVICE_LOG=<WS>/traces/service
       mkdir -p "$SERVICE_LOG"
       DFTRACER_ENABLE=1 DFTRACER_LOG_FILE=<WS>/traces/<RUN_ID> \
         DFTRACER_DATA_DIR=all DFTRACER_TRACE_INTERVAL_MS=1000 \
         "$SERVICE_BIN" start "$SERVICE_LOG"
       # ... run application ...
       "$SERVICE_BIN" stop "$SERVICE_LOG"
  If $SERVICE_BIN is missing, skip service start/stop (service not compiled in).

app: https://github.com/llnl/ior (tag 4.0.0)
context: session_split_traces fails because pfw files are in a subdirectory of traces/
error: |
  {"status": "error", "message": "No .pfw or .pfw.gz files found in <workspace>/traces"}
root_cause: |
  When run_id contains a slash (e.g., "ior/20260617_185032"), dftracer's LOG_FILE is
  set to <workspace>/traces/<run_id>, so it writes:
    <workspace>/traces/ior/20260617_185032-<hash>-app.pfw.gz
  The subdirectory traces/ior/ must be created before the run, AND the split tool
  looks only in traces/ directly (not subdirectories), so files must be copied up.
fix: |
  Before calling session_run_with_dftracer, create the subdirectory:
    mkdir -p <workspace>/traces/<run_id_prefix>   # e.g., traces/ior
  After the run, copy pfw files to the parent traces/ directory before splitting:
    cp <workspace>/traces/ior/*.pfw.gz <workspace>/traces/
  Then call session_split_traces normally.

app: general
context: DFTRACER_INIT=0 prevents the POSIX interceptor from capturing syscall-level events
error: |
  dfanalyzer reports "Total Files: 0" and no POSIX-layer events in trace despite
  application running and C_APP annotations recording correctly.
root_cause: |
  Setting DFTRACER_INIT=0 disables the dftracer constructor, which prevents the
  POSIX LD_PRELOAD interceptor from initializing. Only C_APP (application-level)
  annotations are recorded; open/read/write/close syscalls are never hooked.
  dfanalyzer's posix preset requires POSIX-layer events to compute file I/O metrics.
fix: |
  Do NOT set DFTRACER_INIT=0 when you want POSIX-layer tracing.
  Even when the annotated source has explicit DFTRACER_C_INIT() calls, leave
  DFTRACER_INIT unset (defaults to 1). The auto-init and explicit C_INIT() coexist
  without conflict — C_INIT() is idempotent when dftracer is already initialized.
  Only set DFTRACER_INIT=0 if you explicitly do NOT want POSIX-level tracing.
